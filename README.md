# Three Boxes: A jQuery Lab

This little project is a hands-on exercise for getting comfortable dealing with events in JavaScript (with some help from jQuery).

The basic premise is pretty simple. You have three boxes. You also have three buttons. The buttons don't do anything and neither do the boxes. The good news, is that jQuery is loaded up and you can use it's awesomeness to add magical powers to the buttons and boxes. Your job is to play the important role of mad scientist and hook up the buttons and boxes anyway you please.
